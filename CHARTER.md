SHIELD Project Charter
======================

This charter is effective June 1st, 2019.



A. Mission
----------

The mission of the SHIELD Project is to:

1. produce a scalable, reliable, cloud-native data protection
   solution for providing backup and restore capabilities to cloud
   platforms like Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry;

2. establish an implementation-agnostic ecosystem for the creation
   and deployment of pluggable data- and storage-system
   integrations for said data protection solution; and

3. Advocate and evangelize the use and implementation of said data
   protection solution.



B. Governance Board
-------------------

1. The Governance Board shall be responsible for overall oversight
   of the Project and coordination of the efforts of any Technical
   Committees and Working Groups.

2. The initial governance board will be appointed by the current
   project maintainer, James Hunt, at the time of the adoption of
   this charter.  Following this, the Governance Board will
   implement procedures and methodologies for the selection of
   Governance Board voting members from the contributing community.

3. The Governance Board will encourage transparency (e.g. publish
   public minutes).  Committee and Working Group meetings will be
   open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via
   teleconference, or in person.

4. The Governance Board has the authority to create Committees
   that may focus on code or non-code efforts to advance the
   Mission (such as standards, specifications, and/or
   architecture).

5. Working Groups are established and maintained by Project
   contributors to advance Project work. Working Groups focus on
   specific metric, methodological, ethical, and technical issues
   associated with open source project health.

6. Roles: Committees and Working Groups involve Contributors and
   Maintainers:

    - **Contributors**: anyone in the community that contributes
      code, documentation, use cases, standardized metrics, or
      other community activities related to the Project;

    - **Maintainers**: Contributors who have the ability to commit
      directly to a Project’s repository and are responsive to
      contributions or changes from Contributors. Maintainers are
      listed in the README of each repository.

7. Participation in the Project, including contributions to any
   Committee or Working Group, is open to all under the terms of
   this Charter.

8. The Governance Board may (1) establish work flow procedures for
   the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of Committees
   and projects of Committees, (2) set requirements for the
   promotion to or removal from Committee roles, as applicable,
   and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles as it
   sees fit.

9. Responsibilities: The Governance Board shall also be
   responsible for:

    1. coordinating the direction of the Project;

    2. stablishing any project policies, including for the addition
       and removal of Maintainers and documenting any requirements
       for official project releases;

    3. approving project or system proposals (including, but not
       limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a
       project’s charter or scope); 

    4. establish policies related to intellectual property;

    5. creating Committees to focus on cross-project issues and
       requirements;

    6. facilitating communication and collaboration among
       Technical Committees and Working Groups;

    7. communicating with external and industry organizations
       concerning Project matters;

    8. appointing representatives to work with other open source
       or open standards communities;

    9. establishing community norms, workflows, or policies
       including processes for contributing (to be published on
       the Project web site), issuing releases, and security issue
       reporting policies; and

    10. discussing, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting
        on matters relating to the code base that affect multiple
        projects.



C. Voting
---------

1. While it is the goal of the Project to operate as a consensus
   based community, if any Governance Board or Committee decision
   requires a vote to move forward, the respective voting members
   shall vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

2. Quorum for Governance Board and Committee meetings requires
   two-thirds of all voting members of the Governance Board or a
   Committee, as applicable. The Governance Board or any Committee
   may continue to meet if quorum is not met, but are prevented from
   making any decisions at the meeting. If quorum is not met, a
   second meeting with the same agenda can be called after two weeks
   to which quorum will become 1/2 of all voting members.

3. Except as provided in Section (E)(2)(3) and (F)(1), decisions
   by vote at a meeting shall require a simple majority vote of
   those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by
   electronic vote without a meeting shall require a simple
   majority of all voting members of the Governance Board or a
   Committee, as applicable.

4. In the event a vote cannot be resolved within a Committee, the
   Governance Board may decide the matter.



D. Openness & Inclusivity
-------------------------

1. All participants should encourage open participation from any
   organization able to meet the participation requirements,
   regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
   community may not seek to exclude any participant based on any
   criteria, requirements, or reasons other than those that are
   reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all
   participants.

2. The Governance Board may adopt a fair, reasonable, and
   non-discriminatory Project code-of-conduct.

3. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative,
   and ethical manner at all times.

4. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines,
   decisions, and status will be made open and easily visible to all.



E. Intellectual Property
------------------------

1. The Project seeks to integrate and contribute back to other
   open source projects within the mission set forth in Section
   (A) above. The Project also seeks to assure that relevant
   patentable innovations are made available without the need for
   any patent licenses. Based on this goal for the Project, the
   development community will:

   1. conform to all license requirements of the open source
      projects leveraged by the Project (such projects,
      collectively, "Upstream Projects"); and

   2. maximize opportunities for compatibility with other projects
      that might be leveraged by the Project.

2. Except as described in Section (E)(3), all code
   contributions to the Project are subject to the following:

   1. All new inbound code contributions must be accompanied by
      a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
      (http://developercertificate.org).

   2. All contributions of code will be received and made
      available under the MIT License.

   3. The Governance Board may approve the use of an
      alternative license for inbound or outbound contributions
      on an exception basis.  Exceptions require a two-thirds
      approval of the entire Governance Board.

3. Upstream Project code contributions not stored within the
   Project’s main code repository must comply with the
   contribution process and license terms for the applicable
   Upstream Project.



F. Amendments
-------------

1. This charter may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire
   Governance Board.
